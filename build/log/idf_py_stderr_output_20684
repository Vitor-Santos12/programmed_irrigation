CMake Error at C:/Users/Vitor/esp/esp-idf/tools/cmake/build.cmake:519 (message):
  ERROR: Some components (espressif/led_strip) in the "managed_components"
  directory were modified on the disk since the last run of the CMake.
  Content of this directory is managed automatically.

  If you want to keep the changes, you can move the directory with the
  component to the "components"directory of your project.

  I.E.  for "espressif__led_strip" run:

  mv
  C:\Users\Vitor\Documents\Embedded_Programs\sntp\managed_components\espressif__led_strip
  C:\Users\Vitor\Documents\Embedded_Programs\sntp\components\espressif__led_strip


  Or, if you want to discard the changes remove the ".component_hash" file
  from the component's directory.

  I.E.  for "espressif__led_strip" run:

  rm
  C:\Users\Vitor\Documents\Embedded_Programs\sntp\managed_components\espressif__led_strip\.component_hash
